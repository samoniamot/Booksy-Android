#
#   Gradle start up script for POSIX generated by Gradle.
#
#   Important for running:
#
#   (1) You need a POSIX-compliant shell to run this script. If your /bin/sh is
#       noncompliant, but you have some other compliant shell such as ksh or
#       bash, then to run this script, type that shell name before the whole
#       command line, like:
#
#           ksh Gradle
#
#       Busybox and similar reduced shells will NOT work, because this script
#       requires all of POSIX Shell, and also requires POSIX paths and other
#       standards.
#
#   (2) Note that the Gradle start up script uses `#!/bin/sh` as the shebang.
#       This is known to work in bash, dash, and zsh. Please see the Gradle
#       documentation for more details.
#
#       https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/gradle_wrapper.html
#
#   Important for patching:
#
#   (1) This script targets any POSIX shell, so it avoids extensions provided
#       by Bash, Ksh, etc. The "trap" command is taken from the POSIX standard.
#       Observe that some Bash extensions may not work here.
#
#   (2) This script uses `#!/bin/sh` as the shebang. It is known to work in
#       bash, dash, and zsh. If your system uses a different shell as /bin/sh,
#       you may need to change the shebang.
#
#       You can discover what /bin/sh is on your system by running:
#
#           ls -l /bin/sh
#
#       If it is a symlink to a different shell, you may need to change the
#       shebang to point to the correct shell.
